# Testing with ScalaTest

- Suite, which is simply a collection of zero or more tests. `trait Suite` declares several lifecycle methods that define the way we can write and run tests.
- ScalaTest already offers many style traits that extend `Suite` to support different testing styles.
- We can mixin these style traits together with other stackable traits such as `Matchers` or `BeforeAndAfter`.
