# Design patterns in Scala

* If one starts to think on how to learn/revise the design pattern, either we can go over the order of completing creational, structural and then behavioral design patterns or follow the order recommended by Joshua Kerievsky(Author of the book Refactoring to Patterns) in [this article](https://www.industriallogic.com/papers/learning.html)

* [This github repo josephguan/scala-design-patterns](https://github.com/josephguan/scala-design-patterns) has really good explanation along with examples that explain the design patterns in scala very nicely.

* [Github repo nikolovivan/scala-design-patterns-v2](https://github.com/nikolovivan/scala-design-patterns-v2) contains example snippets for the concepts that are explained in the book **Scala Design Patterns - Second Edition**.

* [This article](https://infinitescript.com/2014/10/the-23-gang-of-three-design-patterns/) gives an overview of all the GOF design patterns
